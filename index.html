                            <p>Meng Yu obtained Master's degree from New York University and have years of experience in Technology field. She is proactively seeking for opportunities that combine her IT professional experience with business academic background. Meng has got hands-on experience on Business Intelligence system, data analytics, data mining, and financial modeling. Machine learning is also an interesting topic that Meng has recently been working on.</p>
                            <p>Driven by great passion in the cross disciplinary study, Meng set out to explore applications of IT technologies in financial market and social science. For example, through machine training, a computer is able to emulate human beings, and make Nash equilibrium decisions. And the advances in data mining can also expand human's capability in understanding complex stock market.</p>
                            <p>This website serves as an online profile for demonstrating Meng's demo models, incorporating the thoughts collected from various experience (mostly related with Business Intelligence). Please click through the tabs above for the online interactive demos. Recommendations of all kinds are welcome, please do not hesitate to email me at <span id="ma"/> . </p>

                                <p>Programming is critical for making smart business decisions based on real-life data. In this process, data collection, storage, processing and visualization are the core modules making up a Business Intelligence (BI) system. With the passion to use programming to solve real-life problems, I built a BI system from scratch.</p>

It gives rise to Application Performance Management (APM), the translation of IT metrics into business meaning that that focuses on monitoring and managing the performance of applications. </p>                               
                                <p> Notebly, today's APM is facing the challenge that the delivery chain has becoming more and more mobile and distributed, reliant on third parties, cloud-based, complex and fragile. Among those trends is one of the hottest debated topic of cloud-computing. With software-as-a-service (SAAS) the most popular type, cloud-computing brings a lot of advantages and has become more and more popular.</p>
                                <!--<p>While cloud-computing, with software-as-a-service (SAAS) the most popular type, brings a lot of advantages: </p>
                                <p><b>Cost Reduction</b> - On one hand, small and mid-size businesses are able to get access to more sophisticated technology at lower prices. On the other hand, it reduces paperwork, lowers transaction costs, and minimizes the invest in hardware (and the resources to manage it). </p>
                                <p><b>Scalablility</b> - Cloud computing services allow businesses to only pay for what they use. And as your business grows, you can accommodate by adding more server space.</p>
                                <p>There are also concerns:</p>
                                <p><b>Corporate Governance</b> - Moving business to 'the cloud' reduces the need for IT staffs, cutting job may bring lawsuits or reputation diminish.</p>

Intuitively thinking, prices of certain stocks tend to go up and down together, either because they are in the same industry or because they are from the same region. This is especially meaningful for portfolio management.</p>

                                <p>Here we provide an interactive demo to demonstrate how such data mining techniques help improve human's understanding of the stock market. Given the stocks (specified by symbols) in the textbox below, we are able to identify their structure from the price correlations in 2012, and visualize such structure with a graph. </p>
                                <!-- Analysis of the demo -->
                                <p>We've already put an example set in the textbox. Click "Run!" to build the visualization. You can also modify the symbols (should be indexed by S&amp;P 500) by yourself and check the results. If the default stocks are used, it's obvious that the financial stocks and IT stocks are separated into two clusters within our visualization.</p>

                                <!-- Usage of the demo -->
                                <p>In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a talk "the Best Stats You've Ever Seen" in which he shared his finding with regards to global health trend. Here we reproduced this animated dashboard showing how pupulations of countries across the world have been developing from 1963 to 2013. Specifically, we are interested to see overall trends in fertility, life expectacy and population.</p><br>

                                <!-- Analysis of the demo -->
                                <p>We draw fertility rate as horizontal axis, overall life expectancy as vertical axis, and the size of red cirle denoting the size of population. It could be inferred that over the course of around five decades, globally fertility rate has been decreasing while life expenctancy increasing, meawhile total popultaion has been increasing as well. In particular, Asia population and average life expenctancy saw much significant increase compared with other regions, indicating a massive expansion of this region. </p><br>
